<h3>bio</h3>

<br>
Erin Elizabeth Birgy is a song-writer and composer of immense power and creativity. Her spiritual musical movements, extra terrestrial jazz chordal style and wild, free vocal and lyrical ability radiate from her main musical outlet, Mega Bog. A real American Wild Horse, Erin also spins cyclones around the U.S. taking crucial dips into many other bands and art universes such as Mega Bog, iji, Eyes Of Love, PBS Network, Medium Soda, Pill Wonder, Pleasure Beauties, Sundance Kids, Remambran, Big Eater, Dogbreth, Sheer Agony, and Dragons to name a few.

Erin recently blew out of Seattle Washington and landed in New York City where she is stretching out as a self-proclaimed, world-renowned musical force and teacher, with plans to write and star in experimental Operas of the heart, collaborate with all of her art-lifer heroes, and produce as much music/as many records as the sky could know. It can be a weird and bad world when it's not ripped properly. Listen for Erin's laugh.
